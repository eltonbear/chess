    %CHESSGAME A class for playing and replaying chess games
    %   Create an instance and use the PLAY() method to play manually,
    %   or use the static method REPLAY() to replay a previous game.
    %   See the help for each method (e.g., "help ChessGame.play")
    %   for details.

            %DIRECTIONS = PLAY(GAME) play() allows you play a chess game
            %manually
            %   If a new game is already in progress, PLAY will continue
            %   it.  Otherwise, it starts a new game.  Team 1 goes first.
            %   It will first display a numbered list of the pieces that 
            %   are available to move along with their current position.
            %   You can enter the piece number, or the position as a 1x2
            %   array (remember the square brackets!).  Once you have
            %   selected a piece, it will display the positions it can move
            %   to and the pieces it can capture.  Enter the position to
            %   move to in square brackets.
            %
            %   The game does not detect checks or checkmates.  Therefore,
            %   it is necessary to actually capture the king to win.  Once
            %   this happens, the game is over.
            %
            %   At any prompt, you can enter -1 to exit the game.  The
            %   state of the game is saved.  The method returns an array of
            %   moves that can be used with the replay method.
